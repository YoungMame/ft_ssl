## Hashing

### Introduction

A hashing algorithm is a one-way function that translates a text to a determined length hash.

#### Example use cases
- Storing passwords securely (combined with a salt to prevent rainbow table attacks)
- Verifying data integrity (checksums)
- Generating unique identifiers for data (hash tables)

#### Goals
- Cannot be possible to reverse the hash to get the original text
- Small changes in the input should produce a significantly different hash (avalanche effect)
- Quick calculation of the hash value
- Low number of collisions (different inputs producing the same hash)

### Algorithms implemented

#### MD5
- Produces a 128-bit hash value
- Broken by collisions for now
- Fast

##### Functioning

1. Pad the message so its length in bits + 64 is multiple of 512
2. Append the original length of the message (in bits) as a 64-bit integer
3. Initialize 4 buffers (A, B, C, D) with specific constants
4. Divide the message into 512-bit chunks
5. Process each chunk in 4 rounds of 16 operations using non-linear functions then add the result to the buffers

    5.1. The fours functions:

        Round 1, : F(X,Y,Z) = (X & Y) | (~X & Z) and g = j
        Round 2 : G(X,Y,Z) = (X & Z) | (Y & ~Z) and g := (5×i + 1) mod 16
        Round 3 : H(X,Y,Z) = X ^ Y ^ Z and g := (3×i + 5) mod 16
        Round 4 : I(X,Y,Z) = Y ^ (X | ~Z) and g := (7×i) mod 16

    5.2. For each of the 64 operations:

        temp = F result + a + constant K at i + words of the current chunk at g
        c become b
        d become c
        a become d
        left rotate temp of value corresponding to the current round in the shifts array and at it to b

    5.3. at the end of the chunk process, add each register to its buffer

6. Concatenate the 4 buffers of 32 bits to produce the final hash (128 bits)

#### SHA-256
- Produces a 256-bit hash value
- More secure than MD5
- Slower than MD5

##### Functioning
1. Pad the message so its length in bits + 64 is multiple of 512

2. Append the original length of the message (in bits) as a 64-bit integer

3. Initialize 8 buffers (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) with specific constants that are the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 prime numbers

4. Divide the message into 512-bit chunks

5 Definition of the functions:

    sigma0(x) = ROTR^2(x) XOR ROTR^13(x) XOR ROTR^22(x)
    sigma1(x) = ROTR^6(x) XOR ROTR^11(x) XOR ROTR^25(x)
    choice(x, y, z) = (x AND y) XOR (NOT x AND z)
    majority(x, y, z) = (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) XOR (y AND z)
    SIGMA2(x) = ROTR^7(x) XOR ROTR^18(x) XOR SHR^3(x)
    SIGMA1(x) = ROTR^17(x) XOR ROTR^19(x) XOR SHR^10(x)

6. Process each chunk in 64 rounds
    6.1 Copy the first 16 words of the chunk into a message array of 64 words

    6.2 Extend the first 16 words into 48 other words using the formula: 

        W[i] = W[i] + sigma1(W[i - 15]) +W[i - 7] + sigma1(W[i - 2])
    
    6.3 Initialize the 8 working variables (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) with the current hash value

    6.4 Compression function main loop on the 64 words:

        temp1 = h + SIGMA1(e) + choice(e, f, g) + K[i] + W[i]
        temp2 = SIGMA0(a) + majority(a, b, c)
        h = g
        g = f
        f = e
        e = d + temp1
        d = c
        c = b
        b = a
        a = temp1 + temp2
    6.5 Add the compressed chunk to the current hash value:

        h0 += a

7. Concatenate the 8 buffers of 32 bits to produce the final hash (256 bits)
